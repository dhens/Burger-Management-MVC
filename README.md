## Installation:
1. Clone repo to your local machine
2. Run "npm install" in the directory of the cloned repo
3. Create and run a MySQL DB using the provided schema.
4. Run "node server.js" to spawn the web-app at localhost:8080

## This repo contains:
* An MVC stucture
* An Express web server
* A MySQL schema for storing burger information
* Handlebars-run front end
* A Home-made ORM 
* URL routing 
* Vanilla CSS 

## Known Issues / Bugs
* N/A

## What I Learned:
* Developing for your local machine is easy. Pushing that same code out to a hosting service can be a nightmare if you aren't aware of the setup required to migrate your project.
* Using an MVC styled project makes file management infinitely more efficient, and compartmentalizing everything makes it easier to see where you might have made a mistake in your code.
